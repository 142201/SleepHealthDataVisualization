## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing lifestyle factors that influence sleep quality and mental health. Using **Microsoft Power BI**, I visualized the correlation between sleep duration, stress levels, physical activity, and occupation to identify patterns regarding sleep disorders such as Insomnia and Sleep Apnea. The goal of this analysis is to provide actionable data-driven insights into how daily habits and demographics impact overall sleep health.

## Data Features
The analysis is based on a dataset covering various health and lifestyle metrics, including:
* **Demographics:** Gender, Age, Occupation.
* **Sleep Metrics:** Sleep Duration, Quality of Sleep (Scale 1-10), Sleep Disorder Status (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea).
* **Lifestyle Factors:** Physical Activity Level, Stress Level, BMI Category, Heart Rate, and Daily Steps.

## Key Insights & Findings

### 1. Occupation vs. Sleep Quality
The analysis reveals a significant disparity in sleep quality across different professions:
* **Highest Quality:** Engineers reported the best sleep quality with an average score of 8.41, followed by Lawyers and Accountants (7.89).
* **Lowest Quality:** Salespersons and Scientists had the lowest scores, averaging between 5.00 and 5.88.

### 2. Key Influencers for Insomnia
Using Power BI's Key Influencers visual, I identified specific drivers for sleep disorders:
* **Sales Profession:** Being a Salesperson increases the likelihood of Insomnia by 6.04x compared to other professions.
* **Teaching Profession:** Being a Teacher increases the risk by 4.51x.

### 3. BMI Category & Stress Levels
There is a notable correlation between Body Mass Index (BMI) and reported stress levels:
* Individuals in the Overweight category reported the highest average stress level (6.76).
* This is significantly higher than those in the Normal (5.89) and Obese (5.78) categories.

### 4. Physical Activity & Sleep Duration
* The data indicates a positive trend between Physical Activity Level and Sleep Duration.
* Metrics such as Daily Steps and Heart Rate were also analyzed across different age groups to observe physiological patterns.

## Tools Used
* **Microsoft Power BI:** Used for data modeling, DAX measures, and creating interactive visualizations (Key Influencers, Decomposition Trees, Scatter Plots).
* **Data Source:** Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset.
